# XStagram ToolKit

XStagram ToolKit is a social media toolkit that I'm writing for my Stranger Things News account on X. 
It will make it easier for us to keep our followers up to date and will automatically post our posts on Instagram.

It will fetch posts from other news account, and will notify us. It will also create its own version of the status using OpenAI API

It will send mobile push notifications using pushover

### MVP (Minimal Viable Product):

- [x] User can sign in with X
- [ ] User can fetch their own posts

- [ ] Tool saves X Posts in database
- [ ] Tool sends a notification when a new version of an existing post from a Listener can be made
- [ ] Tool can automatically create a fitting status for the X post of a Listener that is being reposted
